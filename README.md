# It's a Unix System! I know this!

WebAssembly Unix terminal built with ðŸ¦€RustðŸ¦€

## Features

* Essential Unix commands (sh, ls, cp, mv, cat, cowsay, etc)
* Basic Vi implementation
* Pipes and file redirect
* Variables and subshells
* File system via [rust-vfs](https://github.com/manuel-woelker/rust-vfs)
* Basic scripting support (try `sh example.sh`)
* GNU Readline-like features (key bindings, history, tab-complete)
* ANSI escape code support, including some colors

### Known bugs

* Running `foo=bar echo ${foo}` will print `foo`'s old value
* `[` cannot compare multiword values because of how variable substition works
* No emoji support in `vi`

## Example

```
$ fortune -s | cowsay

Wow what a great fortune
