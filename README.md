* Pipes and file redirect
* File system via [rust-vfs](https://github.com/manuel-woelker/rust-vfs)
* Basic scripting support (try `sh example.sh`)
* Basic GNU Readline-like features (key bindings, history, tab-complete)
* Basic ANSI escape code support, including some colors

### Not included (yet)

* File editor

### Known bugs

* Running `sh -c 'echo -- ${2}'` will recurse forever.
